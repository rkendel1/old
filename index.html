<p>After hard fought elections, a winner emerges. While politics may seem like a zero-sum game, winning doesn't imply representation of only your supporters. Elected officials are responsible for all constituents and should vote accordingly Kuhmpel actively involves all constituents, including non-supporters, to promote accountability and transparency, ensuring elected officials work for the benefit of everyone.</p>
